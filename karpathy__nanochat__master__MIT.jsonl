This includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI so that you can talk to your own LLM just like ChatGPT. nanochat will become the capstone project of the course LLM101n being developed by Eureka Labs.\n\n## Talk to it\n\nTo get a sense of the endpoint of this repo, you can currently find [nanochat d32](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/8) hosted on [nanochat.karpathy.ai](https://nanochat.karpathy.ai/). \"d32\" means that this model has 32 layers in the Transformer neural network. This model has 1.9 billion parameters, it was trained on 38 billion tokens by simply running the single script [run1000.sh](run1000.sh), and the total cost of training was ~$800 (about 33 hours training time on 8XH100 GPU node). While today this is enough to outperform GPT-2 of 2019, it falls dramatically short of modern Large Language Models like GPT-5. When talking to these micro models, you'll see that they make a lot of mistakes, they are a little bit naive and silly and they hallucinate a ton, a bit like children. It's kind of amusing. But what makes nanochat unique is that it is fully yours - fully configurable, tweakable, hackable, and trained by you from start to end. To train and talk to your own, we turn to...\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe fastest way to feel the magic is to run the speedrun script [speedrun.sh](speedrun.sh), which trains and inferences the $100 tier of nanochat. On an 8XH100 node at $24/hr, this gives a total run time of about 4 hours. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like [Lambda](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)), and kick off the training script:\n\n```bash\nbash speedrun.sh\n```\n\nAlternatively, since the script runs for 4 hours, I like to launch it like this inside a new screen session `speedrun` (and also log output to `speedrun.log`):\n\n```bash\nscreen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh\n```\n\nSee the [screen cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jctosta/af918e1618682638aa82) if you are less familiar. You can watch it go inside the screen session, or detach with `Ctrl-a d` and `tail speedrun.log` to view progress. Now wait 4 hours. Once it's done, you can talk to your LLM via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run `source .venv/bin/activate`), and serve it:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.chat_web\n```\n\nAnd then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example [http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/](http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/), etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).\n\n---\n\n<img width=\"2672\" height=\"1520\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed39ddf8-2370-437a-bedc-0f39781e76b5\" />\n\n---\n\nYou can also `cat report.md` file which appeared in the project directory and contains the \"report card\" of the run, i.e. a bunch of evaluations and metrics. At the very end, you'll see a summary table, for example:\n\n---\n\n- Characters: 333,989\n- Lines: 8,304\n- Files: 44\n- Tokens (approx): 83,497\n- Dependencies (uv.lock lines): 2,004\n\n| Metric          | BASE     | MID      | SFT      | RL       |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| CORE            | 0.2219   | -        | -        | -        |\n| ARC-Challenge   | -        | 0.2875   | 0.2807   | -        |\n| ARC-Easy        | -        | 0.3561   | 0.3876   | -        |\n| GSM8K           | -        | 0.0250   | 0.0455   | 0.0758   |\n| HumanEval       | -        | 0.0671   | 0.0854   | -        |\n| MMLU            | -        | 0.3111   | 0.3151   | -        |\n| ChatCORE        | -        | 0.0730   | 0.0884   | -        |\n\nTotal wall clock time: 3h51m\n\n---\n\n(Your table might be missing the RL number by default). For a lot more information around the speedrun script and what to look for and expect, please refer to the walkthrough that I posted in Discussions of the repo: [\"Introducing nanochat: The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy\"](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1).\n\n## Bigger models\n\nUnsurprisingly, $100 is not enough to train a highly performant ChatGPT clone. In fact, LLMs are famous for their multi-million dollar capex. For our purposes, I think there are two more scales of interest. First is the ~$300 tier d26 model (i.e. depth=26) that trains in ~12 hours, which slightly outperforms GPT-2 CORE score. Second is the $1000 tier (~41.6 hours), just because it's a nice round number. But both of these are not yet fully supported and therefore not attached here in the master branch yet.\n\nThat said, to give a sense, the example changes needed for the [speedrun.sh](speedrun.sh) file to train a GPT-2 grade model d26 only involve three changes:\n\n```bash\n...\n# you'll need to download more data shards for pretraining\n# get the number of parameters, multiply 20 to get tokens, multiply by 4.8 to get chars,\n# divide by 250 million to get number of shards. todo need to improve this...\npython -m nanochat.dataset -n 450 &\n...\n# use --depth to increase model size. to not oom, halve device batch size 32 -> 16:\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- --depth=26 --device_batch_size=16\n...\n# make sure to use the same later during midtraining:\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.mid_train -- --device_batch_size=16\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat", "repo": "karpathy/nanochat", "path": "README.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 3, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "92f3fd827e5cdbd54a25f0c58446d13fc23b65814fb25e96d6db35efb35043d8", "tokens": 1665, "bytes": 6007}}
{"text": "h_size=16\n...\n# make sure to use the same later during midtraining:\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.mid_train -- --device_batch_size=16\n```\n\nThat's it! The biggest thing to pay attention to is making sure you have enough data shards to train on (the code will loop and do more epochs over the same training set otherwise, decreasing learning speed a bit), and managing your memory/VRAM, primarily by decreasing the `device_batch_size` until things fit (the scripts automatically compensate by increasing the number of gradient accumulation loops, simply turning parallel compute to sequential compute).\n\nAnd a bit more about computing environments that will run nanochat:\n\n- The code will run just fine on the Ampere 8XA100 GPU node as well, but a bit slower.\n- All code will run just fine on even a single GPU by omitting `torchrun`, and will produce ~identical results (code will automatically switch to gradient accumulation), but you'll have to wait 8 times longer.\n- If your GPU(s) have less than 80GB, you'll have to tune some of the hyperparameters or you will OOM / run out of VRAM. Look for `--device_batch_size` in the scripts and reduce it until things fit. E.g. from 32 (default) to 16, 8, 4, 2, or even 1. Less than that you'll have to know a bit more what you're doing and get more creative.\n- Most of the code is fairly vanilla PyTorch so it should run on anything that supports that - xpu, mps, or etc, but I haven't implemented this out of the box so it might take a bit of tinkering.\n\n## Running on CPU / MPS\n\nnanochat can be run on CPU or on MPS (if you're on Macbook), and will automatically try to detect what device is best to run on. You're not going to get too far without GPUs, but at least you'll be able to run the code paths and maybe train a tiny LLM with some patience. For an example of how to make all the run commands much smaller (feel free to tune!), you can refer to [dev/runcpu.sh](dev/runcpu.sh) file. You'll see that I'm essentially restricting all scripts to train smaller models, to run for shorter number of iterations, etc. This functionality is new, slightly gnarly (touched a lot of code), and was merged in this [CPU|MPS PR](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/pull/88) on Oct 21, 2025.\n\n## Customization\n\nTo customize your nanochat, see [Guide: infusing identity to your nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/139) in Discussions, which describes how you can tune your nanochat's personality through synthetic data generation and mixing that data into midtraining and SFT stages.\n\nAdditionally, to add new abilities to nanochat, see [Guide: counting r in strawberry (and how to add abilities generally)](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/164).\n\n## Questions\n\nnanochat is designed to be short and sweet. One big advantage of this is that we can package up all of the files together and copy paste them to your favorite LLM to ask arbitrary questions. As an example, I like to package up the repo using the [files-to-prompt](https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt) utility like so:\n\n```bash\nfiles-to-prompt . -e py -e md -e rs -e html -e toml -e sh --ignore \"*target*\" --cxml > packaged.txt\n```\n\nThis includes all py, rs, html, toml, sh files, excludes the `rustbpe/target` folder, and chooses the cxml output format. Everything is written to the `packaged.txt` file, which atm measures ~330KB (i.e. well below ~100K tokens for a state of the art LLM), and ~8K lines of code in 45 files.\n\nAlternatively, I recommend using [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/karpathy/nanochat) from Devin/Cognition to ask questions of this repo. In the URL of this repo, simply change github.com to deepwiki.com, and you're off.\n\n## Tests\n\nI haven't invested too much here but some tests exist, especially for the tokenizer.

The goal is to improve the state of the art in micro models that are accessible to work with end to end on budgets of < $1000 dollars.

{"text": "\"\"\"\nShort and crappy script to demonstrate synthetic data generation for\ncustomizing your LLM's identity, or any other aspect really.\n\nIn this example code, we use OpenRouter API to generate synthetic data\nof conversations between a user and an assistant. We use \"Structured Output\"\nfeature to get back JSON data from the API instead of raw text. The conversations\nare saved simply to a .jsonl file in base directory and later loaded and\ntrained on in midtraining or SFT, using the CustomJSON task.\n\nThis specific example shows a humorous attempt to teach nanochat about\nits creator King Andrej Karpathy, because why not :D. Note two things about the\nprompt:\n\n1. We are instructing the LLM how to handle various situations (e.g. foreign language),\n   simply in English. You can infuse any style or behavior in this way.\n2. You'll see that I added a large diversity of user first messages manually,\n   and then I sample 5 random ones from that list into the prompt as an inspiration.\n   This is really important to do because DIVERSITY CONTROL is key. If you don't\n   manually inject diversity, the LLM might generate extremely similar and repetitive\n   conversations and things won't work well. Even this example below is not good enough,\n   for example you might want to actually suggest or inspire conversation topics, or questions,\n   and have a list of that. Basically, this is the KEY creative part to get right. Make sure you\n   manually generate any kind of entropy you can think of and include it in your prompts\n   to maintain healthy and good diversity in the data.\n\nNOTE: You need OpenRouter API key in a file called \"openroutertoken.txt\" in the root directory of the repo.\n      (obviously you can tune this arbitrarily to your liking)\nNOTE: For more details see this discussion: https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/139\n\"\"\"\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport os\nimport copy\nimport random\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed\n\nfrom nanochat.common import get_base_dir\n\napi_key = open(\"openroutertoken.txt\").read().strip()\n\nurl = \"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions\"\nheaders = {\n  \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\",\n  \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n}\n\nreadme = open(\"README.md\").read().strip()\nprompt = r\"\"\"\nI want to generate synthetic data for an LLM to teach it about its identity.

Possibly 2, 3 or so epochs is ~ok, but certainly not ideal and at 10+ epochs we'd\n# start to overfit hard.\n# 5) That's it, everything else (e.g. the learning rates) is adjusted automatically by the training script.\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- --depth=32 --device_batch_size=8 --run=$WANDB_RUN\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_loss\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_eval\n\n# midtrain\n# NOTE: ensure that we use the same device_batch_size here as the base training script.\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.mid_train -- --device_batch_size=8 --run=$WANDB_RUN\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.chat_eval -- -i mid\n\n# sft\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.chat_sft -- --run=$WANDB_RUN\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.chat_eval -- -i sft\n\n# generate final report\npython -m nanochat.report generate\n\n# talk to it\npython -m scripts.chat_web\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat", "repo": "karpathy/nanochat", "path": "run1000.sh", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Bash", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "58cf11e205a07fd088e08da2958a92108b13816162480a9d609112fa599f14db", "tokens": 1464, "bytes": 4748}}

{"text": "# rustbpe\n\n> The missing tiktoken training code\n\nA very lightweight Rust library for training a GPT tokenizer. The issue is that the inference library [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) is great, but only does inference. Separately, the huggingface [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library does training, but it is rather bloated and really hard to navigate because it has to support all the different historical baggage of how people dealt with tokenizers over the years. More recently, I also wrote the [minbpe](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) library which does both training and inference, but only in inefficient Python. Basically what I really want is a non-fancy, super simple, but still relatively efficient training code for GPT tokenizer (more efficient than minbpe, much cleaner/simpler than tokenizers), and then export the trained vocab for inference with tiktoken. Does that make sense? So here we are. There are more opportunities for optimization here, I just stopped a bit early because unlike minbpe before it, rustbpe is now simple and fast enough, and not a significant bottleneck for nanochat.\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat", "repo": "karpathy/nanochat", "path": "rustbpe/README.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "f10fd69cced399a55e67f122485b379481f5a127260758655b28d17e8a44487a", "tokens": 255, "bytes": 1154}}

This new northward detection comes approximately two months after northern detections were reported in Oaxaca and Veracruz, less than 700 miles away from the U.S. border, which triggered the closure of our ports to Mexican cattle, bison, and horses on May 11, 2025.\n\nWhile USDA announced a risk-based phased port re-opening strategy for cattle, bison, and equine from Mexico beginning as early as July 7, 2025, this newly reported NWS case raises significant concern about the previously reported information shared by Mexican officials and severely compromises the outlined port reopening schedule of five ports from July 7-September 15. Therefore, in order to protect American livestock and our nation’s food supply, Secretary Rollins has ordered the closure of livestock trade through southern ports of entry effective immediately.\n\n“The United States has promised to be vigilant — and after detecting this new NWS case, we are pausing the planned port reopening’s to further quarantine and target this deadly pest in Mexico. We must see additional progress combatting NWS in Veracruz and other nearby Mexican states in order to reopen livestock ports along the Southern border,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins. “Thanks to the aggressive monitoring by USDA staff in the U.S. and in Mexico, we have been able to take quick and decisive action to respond to the spread of this deadly pest.”\n\"\"\".strip()\n\n# Random Korean text (to test non-English compression)\nkorean_text = r\"\"\"\n정직한 사실 위에, 공정한 시선을 더하다\nHerald Korea Times\n\n헤럴드코리아타임즈는 정치, 경제, 사회, 문화 등 한국 사회 전반의 주요 이슈를 심도 있게 다루는 종합 온라인 신문사입니다.\n\n우리는 단순히 뉴스를 전달하는 것이 아니라, 사실(Fact)에 기반한 양측의 시각을 균형 있게 조명하며, 독자 여러분이 스스로 판단할 수 있는 ‘정보의 균형’을 제공합니다.\n\n한국 언론의 오랜 문제로 지적되어 온 정치적 편향, 이념적 왜곡에서 벗어나\n오직 정직함과 공정함을 원칙으로 삼는 언론을 지향합니다.\n어느 한쪽의 주장만을 확대하거나 감추지 않고,\n**모든 쟁점에 대해 ‘무엇이 쟁점인지’, ‘누가 무엇을 주장하는지’, ‘사실은 무엇인지’**를 명확히 전달하는 데 집중합니다.\n\"\"\".strip()\n\n# Random piece of code\ncode_text = r\"\"\"\nclass BasicTokenizer(Tokenizer):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def train(self, text, vocab_size, verbose=False):\n        assert vocab_size >= 256\n        num_merges = vocab_size - 256\n\n        # input text preprocessing\n        text_bytes = text.encode(\"utf-8\") # raw bytes\n        ids = list(text_bytes) # list of integers in range 0..255\n\n        # iteratively merge the most common pairs to create new tokens\n        merges = {} # (int, int) -> int\n        vocab = {idx: bytes([idx]) for idx in range(256)} # int -> bytes\n        for i in range(num_merges):\n            # count up the number of times every consecutive pair appears\n            stats = get_stats(ids)\n            # find the pair with the highest count\n            pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n            # mint a new token: assign it the next available id\n            idx = 256 + i\n            # replace all occurrences of pair in ids with idx\n            ids = merge(ids, pair, idx)\n            # save the merge\n            merges[pair] = idx\n            vocab[idx] = vocab[pair[0]] + vocab[pair[1]]\n            # prints\n            if verbose:\n                print(f\"merge {i+1}/{num_merges}: {pair} -> {idx} ({vocab[idx]}) had {stats[pair]} occurrences\")\n\"\"\".strip()\n\nmath_text = r\"\"\"\n\\documentclass[12pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb}\n\\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}\n\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}\n\\newtheorem*{remark}{Remark}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{center}\n{\\Large A Cute Identity: The Sum of Cubes is a Square}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nFor every integer $n \\ge 1$,\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{3} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^{2}.\n\\]\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof 1 (Induction)]\nLet $S(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3$.

The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and NADPH, which fuel the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle in the stroma, wherein ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate is carboxylated by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) to form 3-phosphoglycerate, subsequently reduced and regenerated through a series of enzymatic steps, enabling net assimilation of CO₂ into triose phosphates and ultimately carbohydrates.

{"text": "\"\"\"\nTask intended to make nanochat better in spelling and counting, for example:\n\n\"How many r are in strawberry?\" -> 3\n\nAn interesting part of this task is that we will get the assistant to\nsolve the problem using a combination of manual counting and Python.\nThis is a good problem solving \"instinct\" to mix into the model and RL\nmay further refine it to trust one over the other. If we were extra fancy\n(which we could/should be) we'd add small errors here and there to allow\nthe model also learn recoveries. We can do this in future versions.\n\nThere are two tasks in this file:\n1. SpellingBee: Counting the number of occurrences of a letter in a word\n2. SimpleSpelling: Simply spelling words\n\n(1) is the goal, but (2) exists as a highly condensed version of the part\nthat makes (1) difficult, which is word spelling. This is non-trivial for an\nLLM because it has to learn how every token (a little semantic chunk/atom)\nmaps to the sequence of individual characters that make it up. Larger models\nlearn this eventually on their own, but if we want this capability to exist\nin smaller models, we have to actively encourage it by over-representing it\nin the training data.
