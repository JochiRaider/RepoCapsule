It contains the essential \nfunctionalities needed to interact with PDF forms:\n\n* Inspect what data a PDF form needs to be filled with.\n* Fill a PDF form by simply creating a Python dictionary.\n* Create form fields on a PDF.\n\nIt also supports other common utilities such as extracting pages and merging multiple PDFs together.\n\n## Installing\n\nInstall using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):\n\n```shell script\npip install PyPDFForm\n```\n\n## Quick Example\n![Check out the GitHub repository for a live demo if you can't see it here.](https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm/raw/master/docs/img/demo.gif)\n\nA sample PDF form can be found [here](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/pdfs/sample_template.pdf). Download it and try:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nfilled = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\", adobe_mode=True).fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nfilled.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nAfter running the above code snippet you can find `output.pdf` at the location you specified, \nand it should look like [this](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/pdfs/sample_filled.pdf).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe official documentation can be found on [the GitHub page](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/) of this repository.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n[Chicago Python User Group - Dec 14, 2023](https://youtu.be/8t1RdAKwr9w?si=TLgumBNXv9H8szSn)\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "README.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "046075f26482ff3dd0133270262bad1b7fcaef0b73c5781c14bf55fb4546fde3", "tokens": 766, "bytes": 2745}}

{"text": "# PDF coordinate system\n\nThe PDF coordinate system originates at the bottom left of the page. The unit of measurement is \"points,\" with 72 points per inch. PyPDFForm uses this coordinate system in its APIs to create fields, text, and images on a PDF.\n\n## Generate a coordinate grid view\n\nTo enhance the user experience with the coordinate system, PyPDFForm provides a grid view that helps determine the optimal placement of elements on a PDF.\n\nTo generate a coordinate grid view for [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template.pdf), use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\ngrid_view_pdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\").generate_coordinate_grid(\n    color=(1, 0, 0),    # optional\n    margin=100  # optional\n)\n\ngrid_view_pdf.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nThe `generate_coordinate_grid` method accepts two optional parameters: `color` and `margin`. The `color` parameter sets the grid view color (defaulting to red), and the `margin` parameter adjusts the coordinate grid view's margin in points (defaulting to 100 points).\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/coordinate.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "82f30cb4ee4d87e1054c9b184c16693980142f0ce53157f4112b17250731a1b2", "tokens": 234, "bytes": 1038}}
{"text": "# Pull Request Requirements\n\nWhen submitting a pull request, follow these guidelines for a smooth review process.\n\n## Code changes\n\nPyPDFForm welcomes contributions from developers of all levels and doesn't enforce strict coding rules.\n\nYour PR should follow these conventions:\n\n* Prefer small, incremental changes. For large changes, request a feature branch in your issue and open your PR against that branch, as they will likely need revision before merging into master.\n* Ensure your changes pass all linters. PyPDFForm uses rules from [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), and [pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/). Run `linting` inside the development container to check.\n* Your changes must pass all tests and have 100% coverage. You can read more about testing [here](dev_test.md).\n* If you are changing the user APIs or any other parts of the code that are relevant, please update the appropriate documentation too.\n\n## Merge process\n\nYour PR will be reviewed before merging into the master branch. If your changes are too extensive for inline comments, you may need to reopen your PR against a new feature branch for revision.\n\nAdditionally, your PR must pass these CI checks:\n\n* [Linting](https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm/actions/workflows/python-linting.yml) on the source code.\n* [Tests](https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm/actions/workflows/python-package.yml) will be run on three mainstream operating systems: `ubuntu`, `windows`, and `macos`, and across all Python versions the library supports on each OS.\n\nOnce the CI is green and your code looks good, the PR will be merged into the master branch. They will be deployed on the next release.\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/dev_changes.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "9e19f6cf145b57a9a525a3f6d52e5933d71e9396a693adc16a205b36a266c2c1", "tokens": 382, "bytes": 1725}}

To run the tests, execute:\n\n```shell\ncoverage run -m pytest && coverage report --fail-under=100\n```\n\nAlternatively, in the development container, run:\n\n```shell\ntest\n```\n\n## Generate coverage report\n\nTo generate a test coverage report, run:\n\n```shell\ncoverage run -m pytest && coverage html\n```\n\nView the coverage report by opening `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser.\n\nAlternatively, in the development container, run:\n\n```shell\ncoverage\n```\n\nAnd the coverage report can be found at `http://localhost:8000/htmlcov/index.html`.\n\n## Test breakdown\n\nAlthough each PyPDFForm test is unique, most follow a general paradigm.\n\nMost tests can be summarized into three steps:\n\n* Define an expected PDF file that the outcome of the test should look like.\n* Execute a sequence of code using PyPDFForm to generate a PDF that should look like the expected PDF file.\n* Compare the PDF generated by the test with the expected PDF file.\n\nConsider this example test:\n\n```python\ndef test_fill(pdf_samples, request):\n    expected_path = os.path.join(pdf_samples, \"sample_filled.pdf\")\n    with open(expected_path, \"rb+\") as f:\n        obj = PdfWrapper(\n            os.path.join(pdf_samples, \"sample_template.pdf\")\n        ).fill(\n            {\n                \"test\": \"test_1\",\n                \"check\": True,\n                \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n                \"check_2\": False,\n                \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n                \"check_3\": True,\n            },\n        )\n\n        request.config.results[\"expected_path\"] = expected_path\n        request.config.results[\"stream\"] = obj.read()\n\n        expected = f.read()\n\n        assert len(obj.read()) == len(expected)\n        assert obj.read() == expected\n```\n\nThe test starts by defining an expected PDF `sample_filled.pdf`:\n\n```python\nexpected_path = os.path.join(pdf_samples, \"sample_filled.pdf\")\n```\n\nThe test then fills `sample_template.pdf` with a data dictionary using `PdfWrapper`:\n\n```python\nobj = PdfWrapper(\n    os.path.join(pdf_samples, \"sample_template.pdf\")\n).fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n```\n\nInclude these two lines in most tests to simplify updating old tests:\n\n```python\nrequest.config.results[\"expected_path\"] = expected_path\nrequest.config.results[\"stream\"] = obj.read()\n```\n\nFinally, the test compares the resulted stream from the test with the expected file stream:\n\n```python\nexpected = f.read()\n\nassert len(obj.read()) == len(expected)\nassert obj.read() == expected\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/dev_test.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "8e61ce1f180ee916a84711f19830703cadedae39a855c28fab2160262df09c24", "tokens": 631, "bytes": 2722}}

You can disable this by setting the `preserve_aspect_ratio` property to `False` on the signature field:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template_with_signature.pdf\")\npdf.widgets[\"signature\"].preserve_aspect_ratio = False\npdf.fill(\n    {\n        \"signature\": \"sample_signature.png\"\n    },\n)\n\npdf.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Fill image field\n\nFill an image field similarly to a signature field, using a file path, file object, or file stream.\n\nTo fill an image field, consider [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template_with_image_field.pdf) and [this image](https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm/raw/master/image_samples/sample_image.jpg):\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nfilled = PdfWrapper(\n    \"sample_template_with_image_field.pdf\",\n    adobe_mode=False    # optional, set to True for Adobe Acrobat compatibility\n).fill(\n    {\n        \"image_1\": \"sample_image.jpg\"\n    },\n    flatten=False   # optional, set to True to flatten the filled PDF form\n)\n\nfilled.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nUnlike the signature field, the library does not preserve the aspect ratio of a regular image by default. You can enable this by setting the `preserve_aspect_ratio` property to `True` on the image field:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template_with_image_field.pdf\")\npdf.widgets[\"image_1\"].preserve_aspect_ratio = True\npdf.fill(\n    {\n        \"image_1\": \"sample_image.jpg\"\n    },\n)\n\npdf.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/fill.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "21d92a28f3ff83393293fe6ae213de58e238cce19a57e9e3726740ddc1b49fa7", "tokens": 1212, "bytes": 5137}}

{"text": "# Installation and setup\n\nPyPDFForm is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip, which is the most common and recommended tool.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nPyPDFForm officially supports Python 3.10 and newer versions that are currently in their active life cycles. This typically includes the minimum supported version and the four major versions above it. For details on Python version life cycles, refer to [this page](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).\n\n**NOTE:** While official support is limited to active Python versions, PyPDFForm generally avoids features specific to particular major Python versions. It is expected to be functional with Python 3.7+ (due to its use of [Postponed Evaluation of Annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/) for type hints, introduced in Python 3.7), though these versions are not actively tested.\n\n## Install using pip\n\nIt is highly recommended to create a virtual environment before installation. Then, run the following command to install PyPDFForm:\n\n```shell\npip install PyPDFForm\n```\n\nTo upgrade PyPDFForm and all its dependencies, run:\n\n```shell\npip install -U PyPDFForm\n```\n\n## Create a PDF wrapper\n\nThe main user interface of the library is the `PdfWrapper` class. It implements most PyPDFForm APIs and accepts various optional parameters, the most important of which is the PDF form template.\n\nFor example, to use [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template.pdf) as a template, instantiate the `PdfWrapper` object as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n```\n\nPyPDFForm provides an adapter for different file interaction methods in Python, which allows you to pass your PDF form to `PdfWrapper` as a file path, an open file object, or a `bytes` file stream.\n\nThis means the following two snippets are equivalent to the above:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nwith open(\"sample_template.pdf\", \"rb+\") as template:\n    pdf = PdfWrapper(template)\n```\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nwith open(\"sample_template.pdf\", \"rb+\") as template:\n    pdf = PdfWrapper(template.read())\n```\n\nThis file adaptation applies to all PyPDFForm APIs. You can replace file path parameters with file objects or streams throughout the documentation.\n\n## Create an Adobe Acrobat compatible PDF wrapper\n\nAdobe Acrobat has known issues displaying PDF forms with filled text fields. Specifically, the text content may only be visible when the text field is selected. This issue is not present in browsers like Chrome or PDF viewers such as Document Viewer (the default PDF application on Ubuntu).\n\nBy setting the optional parameter `adobe_mode` (default value is `False`) to `True` when instantiating the `PdfWrapper` object, you ensure that the PDF can be processed and displayed correctly by Adobe Acrobat:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\", adobe_mode=True)\n```\n\n**NOTE:** PDF objects with `adobe_mode` enabled are optimized for viewing in Adobe Acrobat. Other PDF viewers might experience rendering issues with certain field styles, such as text font or field borders. Therefore, only enable `adobe_mode` when the generated PDFs are intended to be viewed with Adobe Acrobat.\n\n## Use full name for PDF form fields\n\nAccording to section 12.7.3.2 of the [PDF standard](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/pdfstandards/PDF32000_2008.pdf) (page 434), PDF form fields can have fully qualified names constructed using the pattern `<parent_field_name>.<field_name>`.\n\nPyPDFForm allows you to access fields by their full names by setting `use_full_widget_name` to `True` when instantiating `PdfWrapper`. For example, to use [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template_with_full_key.pdf):\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template_with_full_key.pdf\", use_full_widget_name=True)\n```\n\nThis enables accessing fields by their full names. For instance, you can access the checkbox labeled `Gain de 2 classes` using its full name `Gain de 2 classes.0` instead of its partial name `0`.\n\n**NOTE:** When using full names, the `update_widget_key` and `commit_widget_key_updates` methods of `PdfWrapper` are disabled and raise a `NotImplementedError` because full names involve both the field and its parent.\n\n## Write to a file\n\n`PdfWrapper` behaves like an open file object, allowing you to write the PDF to another file object. For example, to write to a disk file:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\nwith open(\"output.pdf\", \"wb+\") as output:\n    output.write(pdf.read())\n```\n\nIt doesn't have to be a disk file; it can be a memory buffer as well:\n\n```python\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\nwith BytesIO() as output:\n    output.write(pdf.read())\n```\n\nIn addition to behaving like a file object, `PdfWrapper` also implements a `write` method that allows you to write the PDF to a disk file by specifying the path:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\npdf.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/install.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "838c75befdc3b99ee529b7d73b855846117dadf021d3a78b9a62fcf184c71eda", "tokens": 1161, "bytes": 5110}}

{"text": "# 2025-03-29: Announcements\n\nHello fellow Python developers! With the release of v2.0.0, there are some important changes I'm making to the library:\n\n* Since I started developing the library, versioning releases has been quite unorthodox, and there isn't any convention I followed. Starting with v2.0.0, PyPDFForm will version releases following the conventions defined by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\n* PyPDFForm now renders PDF form widgets! Ever since its ancestral stage, the library has only been able to render the data you filled into a PDF form. Now if you fill a PDF form using `PdfWrapper`, the result will render the whole widget instead of just the value that got filled. If you would like to disable this behavior, please refer to the docs [here](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/fill/#disable-rendering-widgets).\n\nHappy hacking!\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/news/2025-03-29.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "58941a48aa9a8ba6f7770514d2c77940a4b9e8879a3d5b570ed79d45d018f02b", "tokens": 203, "bytes": 867}}
{"text": "# 2025-05-24: V3 Announcements\n\nThis article provides important information about the upcoming v3.0.0 release.\n\n## TL; DR\n\nPyPDFForm v3.0.0 is scheduled for release on June 24, 2025. This major release includes changes that will break compatibility with older code. To avoid issues, pin your version to <=2.5.0 as soon as possible.\n\nHere's a list of the changes:\n\n* `FormWrapper` has been removed. Its features have been moved to `PdfWrapper`. The `fill` method of `PdfWrapper` will now work the same way it did in `FormWrapper`.\n* The way to enable `adobe_mode` when filling has changed. Instead of passing `adobe_mode` as an argument to the `fill` method, you now pass it when creating a `PdfWrapper` object.\n* Setting font properties for the entire document (e.g., `PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\", global_font_size=20)`) is no longer supported. You must now set font properties for each individual widget.\n* `register_font` is now a method of the `PdfWrapper` object, not a general class method.\n* `PdfWrapper.preview` is removed.\n* You can no longer change the `button_style` of existing checkboxes or radio buttons. (Setting the `button_style` when you create them is still supported.)\n* Render widgets flag `render_widgets` is removed.\n\n## Why these changes?\n\nWhen I started this project about five years ago, I didn't have as much experience as I do now. I ran into some technical problems during the initial proof of concept. One problem was that filled text fields in Adobe Acrobat sometimes only appeared when the field was selected.\n\nBecause of this behavior in Adobe Acrobat, and because I wanted to support as many PDF viewers as possible, I decided to use a \"watermark\" approach. Instead of directly changing the form field data, this approach gathers information about each field, such as its location, font, size, and color. Then, it removes all the original form fields, creates a watermark of the PDF, draws the filled content onto the watermark, and combines the watermark with the original PDF. Even though this removes the original fields and makes the filled content look \"flattened\", it ensures that the filled PDFs only contain basic PDF data and can be viewed in any PDF application. The project has grown since then, adding features like custom form field styles and even the ability to create form fields. As of version 2.5.0, the `PdfWrapper` still uses this watermark method as its core.\n\nAbout a year ago, with the help of the community, I was finally able to solve the text field issue in Adobe Acrobat that had been present since the beginning of the project. This made it possible to directly modify the form field data when filling a PDF, which has several benefits: the form fields can remain editable after filling, there's no need for complicated calculations to determine coordinates and resolutions, and merging watermarks with the original PDF is no longer necessary, which greatly improves performance. However, the project had already developed significantly, and some features that relied on the watermark approach, such as changing font properties, couldn't be easily adapted to the new method, at least not initially. Therefore, instead of completely abandoning the watermark approach, I decided to create a new, simpler set of APIs that would support this new way of filling forms. This resulted in the `FormWrapper`.\n\nThe `FormWrapper` turned out to be a good addition, attracting even more users because it could truly \"fill\" a PDF form as if it were done by hand. Since then, `PdfWrapper` and `FormWrapper` have existed side-by-side. However, recent developments have made it necessary to introduce even more significant and fundamental changes to the project. First, I've noticed that many users, even when using features from `PdfWrapper` like creating or renaming widgets, prefer to use `FormWrapper` for the final step of filling the PDF. In these situations, I've had to advise them to first perform the necessary actions with `PdfWrapper`, extract the stream from the `PdfWrapper` object, and then use that as input for `FormWrapper` to complete the filling process. This workflow doesn't seem very intuitive. Second, I've developed some extremely complex calculations to determine how form field data should be drawn when using the watermark method. However, I've reached a point where I can't figure out how to support landscape PDFs due to orientation issues. This makes abandoning the watermark approach even more desirable. Finally, my recent research has revealed clearer ways to implement features that were previously only achievable through the watermark method by directly manipulating form field data.\n\nConsidering everything mentioned above, I believe it's time to introduce the next major version of PyPDFForm: v3.0.0.\n\n## What are the changes?\n\nIn short, the goal of v3.0.0 can be summed up to:\n\n* Merge `FormWrapper` into `PdfWrapper`.\n* Reimplement most, if not all, `PdfWrapper` features, especially the `fill` method, by directly manipulating form field data.\n* Preserve as much backward compatibility as possible.\n\nLet's talk more about backward compatibility. With changes as significant as those in this release, it's impossible to maintain complete backward compatibility. For instance, even if you use the `fill` method in the same way as before, the filled PDF forms will now be editable because the watermark method is no longer used.\n\nSo, when I say I've tried to preserve as much backward compatibility as possible, I mean I've minimized the number of API changes. The appearance of your generated PDFs will be slightly different compared to the watermark approach, but you'll still be able to use most of PyPDFForm's APIs in the same way as before the release.\n\nHowever, some unavoidable changes will break backward compatibility. This is why this release is a major version update, as defined by Semantic Versioning. I'll do my best to explain these changes and the reasons behind them in the list below:\n\n* As mentioned earlier, `FormWrapper` has been merged into `PdfWrapper` and completely removed. `FormWrapper` only provided basic PDF form filling features. After the merge, the `fill` method of `PdfWrapper` will function identically to how it did in `FormWrapper`.\n* The `adobe_mode` parameter has been moved from the `fill` method to the `PdfWrapper` object's constructor. This change is necessary because most `PdfWrapper` features now directly manipulate form field data and need to support Adobe Acrobat. Therefore, the setting applies to the entire object rather than just the filling method.\n* Previously, font properties could be set globally for each object using parameters like `global_font`, `global_font_size`, and `global_font_color` when creating the object. This is no longer possible. Font properties must now be set for each individual widget. Setting font properties globally made sense when they all needed to be applied to the same watermarks. Now that the project directly manipulates form fields, it's more logical to set them at the widget level.\n* `register_font` is now a method that belongs to each `PdfWrapper` object, rather than a general class method. This change should have been made earlier, and it's becoming more obvious with this release, as each registered font should only be used for a single PDF form.\n* The `preview` feature has been removed. It was initially an experimental feature and has proven to create messy, unreadable previews for PDFs with many fields. There are better ways to inspect a PDF form, such as using `schema` and `sample_data`.\n* Modifying the `button_style` of existing checkboxes or radio buttons by directly manipulating form field data is difficult, as it involves complex stream creation that I'm currently unable to implement. Therefore, this feature has been removed for now but may be added back in the future. Note that this change doesn't affect the ability to set the `button_style` when creating checkboxes or radio buttons.\n* `render_widgets` has been removed. This feature was originally added to maintain backward compatibility when the watermark approach first began supporting the rendering of widget borders and backgrounds. Since the watermark approach is no longer used, this feature is unnecessary.\n\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/news/2025-05-24.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 2, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "f7684c7506cd58776a9d228c605dbf9e5342b3c35f91a1ba171c5807ac4b2be9", "tokens": 1716, "bytes": 8277}}

{"text": "# Create form fields\n\nThe most common tool for creating PDF form fields is Adobe Acrobat, and a tutorial is available [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/creating-distributing-pdf-forms.html). Alternative free tools like [DocFly](https://www.docfly.com/) offer similar functionality.\n\nPyPDFForm also allows creating PDF form fields on existing PDFs through coding.\n\nThis section of the documentation will primarily use [this PDF](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf) as an example.\n\nUnderstanding [the PDF coordinate system](coordinate.md) is necessary for this section.\n\nAll optional parameters will have a comment `# optional` after each of them.\n\n## Create a text field\n\nA text field can be created by downloading the PDF and running the following snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.TextField(\n        name=\"new_text_field\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=57.5,\n        y=700.9,\n        required=False,  # optional\n        tooltip=\"this is a text field\",  # optional\n        width=120.3,  # optional\n        height=40.7,  # optional\n        max_length=5,  # optional, number of characters\n        comb=True,  # optional, when set to True, max_length must also be set\n        font=\"your_registered_font\",  # optional\n        font_size=15,  # optional\n        font_color=(1, 0, 0),  # optional\n        bg_color=(0, 0, 1, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_color=(1, 0, 0, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_width=5,  # optional\n        alignment=0,  # optional, 0=left, 1=center, 2=right\n        multiline=True,  # optional\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nTo use a custom font, see how to register it [here](font.md).\n\n**NOTE:** For the `comb` option, refer to the documentation [here](style.md/#enable-text-field-character-spacing-combs).\n\n## Create a checkbox\n\nA checkbox can be created using the same method with some changes to the parameters:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.CheckBoxField(\n        name=\"new_checkbox\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=57,\n        y=700,\n        required=False,  # optional\n        tooltip=\"this is a checkbox\",  # optional\n        size=30,  # optional\n        button_style=\"check\",  # optional\n        tick_color=(0, 1, 0),  # optional\n        bg_color=(0, 0, 1, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_color=(1, 0, 0, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_width=5,  # optional\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nThe `button_style` parameter currently supports three options: `check`, `circle`, and `cross`.\n\n**NOTE:** To remove the border of a checkbox, set the alpha channel of the `border_color` to 0, for example: `border_color=(1, 0, 0, 0)`. Setting `border_width` to 0 may still render a border with a width of 1 due to a PDF specification quirk.\n\n## Create a radio button group\n\nUnlike other field types, radio buttons must be created as a group. Therefore, for the coordinate parameters `x` and `y`, you must specify a list of coordinates for each radio button within the group, and the list must contain more than one coordinate.\n\nOtherwise, radio button creation shares almost the same parameters as a checkbox:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.RadioGroup(\n        name=\"new_radio_group\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=[50, 100, 150],\n        y=[50, 100, 150],\n        required=False,  # optional\n        tooltip=\"this is a radio group\",  # optional\n        size=30,  # optional\n        button_style=\"check\",  # optional\n        shape=\"square\",  # optional, circle or square\n        tick_color=(0, 1, 0),  # optional\n        bg_color=(0, 0, 1, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_color=(1, 0, 0, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_width=5,  # optional\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n**NOTE:** To remove the border of a group of radio buttons, set the alpha channel of the `border_color` to 0, for example: `border_color=(1, 0, 0, 0)`. Setting `border_width` to 0 may still render a border with a width of 1 due to a PDF specification quirk.\n\n## Create a dropdown field\n\nA dropdown field shares a similar set of parameters as a text field. The only significant difference is that a list of `options` needs to be specified:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.DropdownField(\n        name=\"new_dropdown\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=57,\n        y=700,\n        options=[\n            \"foo\",\n            \"bar\",\n            \"foobar\",\n        ],\n        required=False,  # optional\n        tooltip=\"this is a dropdown\",  # optional\n        width=120,  # optional\n        height=40,  # optional\n        font=\"your_registered_font\",  # optional\n        font_size=15,  # optional\n        font_color=(1, 0, 0),  # optional\n        bg_color=(0, 0, 1, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_color=(1, 0, 0, 1),  # optional, (r, g, b, alpha)\n        border_width=5,  # optional\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nTo use a custom font, see how to register it [here](font.md).\n\nIf you want different export values from the displayed options, you can specify a list of tuples for the `options` parameter, where the first value of each tuple is the displayed option and the second value is the export value:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.DropdownField(\n        name=\"new_dropdown\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=57,\n        y=700,\n        options=[\n            (\"option_1\", \"option_1_export_value\"),\n            (\"option_2\", \"option_2_export_value\"),\n            (\"option_3\", \"option_3_export_value\"),\n        ],\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Create a signature field\n\nA signature field is only interactive in tools that support it. Otherwise, it is displayed as a rectangle, and clicking it will not trigger any action:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.SignatureField(\n        name=\"new_signature\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=100,\n        y=100,\n        required=False,  # optional\n        tooltip=\"this is a signature\",  # optional\n        width=410,  # optional\n        height=100,  # optional\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/prepare.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 2, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "b131c854518c78293efbb2ae30f84213cabab971b4eeb8bdc320ed0871c1e847", "tokens": 1732, "bytes": 6562}}
{"text": "\n## Create an image field\n\nSimilar to a signature field, an image field is also only interactive in tools that support it:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import Fields, PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\").create_field(\n    Fields.ImageField(\n        name=\"new_image\",\n        page_number=1,\n        x=100,\n        y=100,\n        required=False,  # optional\n        tooltip=\"this is an image\",  # optional\n        width=192,  # optional\n        height=108,  # optional\n    )\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Modify the key of a field\n\nPyPDFForm allows you to modify the keys of existing fields. For example, to change the key of the first text field, `test`, to `test_text` using [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template.pdf), use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\").update_widget_key(\n    \"test\", \"test_text\"\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nIf multiple fields share the same key, use the `index` parameter to specify which one to update. For instance, to change the key of the second row's text field with the key `Description[0]` to `Description[1]` using [this PDF](pdfs/733.pdf), use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"733.pdf\").update_widget_key(\n    \"Description[0]\", \"Description[1]\", index=1\n)\n\nnew_form.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nFor bulk updates, improve performance by setting `defer=True` when updating each key, then call `commit_widget_key_updates()` at the end to commit all changes.\n\nTo change the key of each row's text field with the key `Description[0]` to `Description[i]`, where `i` is the index of each row, using [this PDF](pdfs/733.pdf), use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nnew_form = PdfWrapper(\"733.pdf\")\n\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n    new_form.update_widget_key(\n        \"Description[0]\", f\"Description[{i}]\", index=1, defer=True\n    )\n\nnew_form.commit_widget_key_updates().write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/prepare.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 2, "n_chunks": 2, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "0c8a338c3a921ddcfb710698feb330afef9ad9804035f361a63717bb82046ef4", "tokens": 507, "bytes": 1988}}
{"text": "# Change form field styles\n\nPyPDFForm enables you to modify some field styles through code, allowing you to change field appearances without altering the PDF form template.\n\nThis section of the documentation will primarily use [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template.pdf) as an example.\n\n## Change text field font\n\nBefore changing a text field's font, you must first [register](font.md) the desired font.\n\nAfter registration, you can apply the registered font to any text field:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper, Text\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\n# change globally by iterating each text field\nfor field in form.widgets.values():\n    if isinstance(field, Text):\n        field.font = \"your_registered_font\"\n\n# or change at each field's widget level\nform.widgets[\"test\"].font = \"your_registered_font\"\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change text field font size\n\nYou can change the font size using a `float` value in PyPDFForm:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper, Text\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\n# change globally by iterating each text field\nfor field in form.widgets.values():\n    if isinstance(field, Text):\n        field.font_size = 20\n\n# or change at each field's widget level\nform.widgets[\"test\"].font_size = 30.5\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change text field font color\n\nYou can change the font color using an RGB `tuple`:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper, Text\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\n# change globally by iterating each text field\nfor field in form.widgets.values():\n    if isinstance(field, Text):\n        field.font_color = (1, 0, 0)\n\n# or change at each field's widget level\nform.widgets[\"test\"].font_color = (0.2, 0, 0.5)\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change text field alignment\n\nYou can change the alignment of the text filled into a text field by setting its `alignment` property to an integer value: `0` for left, `1` for center, and `2` for right.\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper, Text\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\n# change globally by iterating each text field\nfor field in form.widgets.values():\n    if isinstance(field, Text):\n        field.alignment = 1 # center\n\n# or change at each field's widget level\nform.widgets[\"test\"].alignment = 2  # right\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change text field max length\n\nYou can change the maximum number of characters allowed in a text field:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper, Text\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\n# change globally by iterating each text field\nfor field in form.widgets.values():\n    if isinstance(field, Text):\n        field.max_length = 4\n\n# or change at each field's widget level\nform.widgets[\"test\"].max_length = 2\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Enable text field character spacing (combs)\n\nTo enable character spacing in a text field, set its `.comb` property to `True`. This will evenly space out the characters of the text filled into the field. Note that this property only takes effect when the text field also has a `max_length` set.\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper, Text\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\n# change globally by iterating each text field\nfor field in form.widgets.values():\n    if isinstance(field, Text):\n        field.max_length = 4\n        field.comb = True\n\n# or change at each field's widget level\nform.widgets[\"test\"].max_length = 2\nform.widgets[\"test\"].comb = True\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Enable multiline text field\n\nTo enable multiline input for a text field, set its `.multiline` property to `True`. This effectively transforms it into a paragraph field:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\nform.widgets[\"test\"].multiline = True\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\\ntest_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\\ntest_2\",\n        \"check_2\": False,\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\\ntest_3\",\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change checkbox/radio button size\n\nYou can change the size of a checkbox or a group of radio buttons using a `float` value:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\n\nform.widgets[\"check\"].size = 50\nform.widgets[\"check_2\"].size = 40\nform.widgets[\"check_3\"].size = 60\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"check\": True,\n        \"check_2\": True,\n        \"check_3\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change dropdown field choices\n\nTo modify the options available in a dropdown field, assign a new list of strings to the `.choices` attribute of the corresponding field. For instance, the following code snippet updates the `dropdown_1` field in [this PDF form](pdfs/sample_template_with_dropdown.pdf) with a new set of choices:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template_with_dropdown.pdf\")\n\nform.widgets[\"dropdown_1\"].choices = [\"\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"dates\"]\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nIf you want different export values from the displayed options, you can specify a list of tuples for the `.choices` attribute, where the first value of each tuple is the displayed option and the second value is the export value:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template_with_dropdown.pdf\")\n\nform.widgets[\"dropdown_1\"].choices = [\n    (\"\", \"blank_export_value\"),\n    (\"apple\", \"apple_export_value\"),\n    (\"banana\", \"banana_export_value\"),\n    (\"cherry\", \"cherry_export_value\"),\n    (\"dates\", \"dates_export_value\"),\n]\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/style.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 2, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "c0f48fab6cd218cb78a0a820f4ee8b3629f38f863ca204c002950c354f435ee2", "tokens": 1706, "bytes": 6668}}

Setting `readonly` to `True` flattens the field, making it uneditable, while setting it to `False` unflattens it, making it editable. For example, the following code snippet shows how you can make different form fields editable in [this PDF form](pdfs/sample_template_with_dropdown.pdf) after they have been flattened:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nform = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template_with_dropdown.pdf\")\n\nform.fill(\n    {\n        \"test_1\": \"test_1\",\n        \"test_2\": \"test_2\",\n        \"test_3\": \"test_3\",\n        \"check_1\": True,\n        \"check_2\": True,\n        \"check_3\": True,\n        \"radio_1\": 1,\n        \"dropdown_1\": 0,\n    },\n    flatten=True,\n)\nform.widgets[\"test_2\"].readonly = False  # text\nform.widgets[\"check_3\"].readonly = False  # checkbox\nform.widgets[\"radio_1\"].readonly = False  # radio button group\nform.widgets[\"dropdown_1\"].readonly = False  # dropdown\n\nform.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/style.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 2, "n_chunks": 2, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "84fc88536db2b4948a50dded7d0f7d0dbb9304fcb4bef9a4f389017e7989f77a", "tokens": 499, "bytes": 1987}}
{"text": "# Other utilities\n\nPyPDFForm offers additional utilities similar to other PDF libraries.\n\nThis section of the documentation uses [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template.pdf) as an example.\n\n## Extract pages\n\nThe `PdfWrapper` object has a `.pages` attribute, which is a list of `PdfWrapper` objects representing individual pages:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nfirst_page = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\").pages[0]\nfirst_page.fill(\n    {\n        \"test\": \"test_1\",\n        \"check\": True,\n    },\n)\n\nfirst_page.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Merge multiple PDFs\n\nYou can merge multiple PDF files by adding their `PdfWrapper` objects. For example, to merge [this PDF](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf) and [this PDF](pdfs/sample_template.pdf):\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf_one = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\")\npdf_two = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\nmerged = pdf_one + pdf_two\n\nmerged.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\nTo reorganize pages:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\npdf_one = PdfWrapper(\"dummy.pdf\")\npdf_two = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\")\nmerged = pdf_two.pages[0] + pdf_one + pdf_two.pages[1] + pdf_two.pages[2]\n\nmerged.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n\n## Change PDF version\n\nPyPDFForm allows you to modify the PDF version up to 2.0:\n\n```python\nfrom PyPDFForm import PdfWrapper\n\nnew_version = PdfWrapper(\"sample_template.pdf\").change_version(\"2.0\")\nnew_version.write(\"output.pdf\")\n```\n", "meta": {"source": "https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "repo": "chinapandaman/PyPDFForm", "path": "docs/utils.md", "license": "MIT", "lang": "Markdown", "chunk_id": 1, "n_chunks": 1, "encoding": "utf-8", "had_replacement": false, "sha256": "6b2f2846f0a43b5387a7443da2a9a571044a940ae1e385096ef4adcbba45c7f0", "tokens": 366, "bytes": 1449}}
